    header: 'Interlocks',
    info: 'Interlocks are generally smaller locs that are maintained and started via a method called interlocking, which crochets the hair together. Some people choose interlocks because retightenings often last longer and you can do things such as swim or wash your hair immediately after a retightening with no ill effect. Interlocking can also be used to maintain other types of locs as well.',

    header: 'Sisterlocks',
    info: 'Sisterlocks are micro locs (very small locs) They come in several different sizes. Since sisterlocks are a patented technique, they can be expensive to install and maintain, but they offer a lot of versatility in terms of hair styling options and the same benefits as interlocking above.',

    header: 'Traditional locs',
    info: "Traditional locs are a long-term hair style that can be started using many methods - most popularly, twists or comb coils. Traditional locs are normally retwisted using palm rolling - however, it's possible to get traditional locs and then switch to a different retightening technique. Traditional locs are larger than other locs and someone with traditional locs will have fewer locs than someone with micro locs.",

    info: 'This site was designed to make the process of finding a loctician much easier for black people with locs. In my own search for a loctician, I often noticed that it was difficult to filter out stylists who do not work with my hair texture or to find stylists who specialized in locs beyond traditional locs. It was even difficult to find people to start locs in less common ways. This site tries to make this process a little easier for others. ',
