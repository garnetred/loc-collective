# Abstract 

This is a website that uses the Yelp API in order to create a national directory of locticians for black people with locs in the United States.

## Tools 
This application was bootstrapped with Create React App, and uses ReactJS, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I used the Jest testing library along with React Testing Library to test each component. I created a low fidelity wireframe, mockup, and prototype using Figma. 

## Setup/Installation

In order to use this application, you can first clone down this repo. Since this application uses environment variables, you will need to request a Yelp Api key. Once you've received the key, you can create your own .env file and store the API key under the variable REACT_APP_API_KEY, after which you can complete the following steps:  

Navigate to the repository's location on your computer. Run the `cd` command to enter the repository, then run `npm install`. After this has been completed, you can run `npm start` to view the code via the React server, typically at http://localhost:3000. 

## Prototype 
I used the below prototype created using Figma as a basis for my application.

## Future Iterations
In the future, I hope to add functionality to sort by distance, rating, or price. I'm also in the process of adding resources and information to the styles and resources pages. Finally, I hope to use PHP to implement a contact form. 

## Final Site 
Here is a preview of the site:

## Deployed Site
I've deployed the site via Netlify using continuous deployment. You can view the current site via this link: https://loccollective.netlify.app/. The [backend node server](https://github.com/garnetred/loc-collective-backend) is deployed automatically using Heroku.
