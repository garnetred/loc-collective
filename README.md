# Abstract 

This is a website that uses the Yelp API in order to create a national directory of locticians for black people with locs in the United States.

## Tools 
This application was bootstrapped with Create-React-App, and uses ReactJS, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I used the Jest testing library along with React Testing Library to test each component. I created a low fidelity wireframe, mockup, and prototype using Figma. 

## Setup/Installation

In order to use this application, you can first clone down this repo. 

After you've navigated to the repository's location on your computer, you can `cd` into the repository, then open your terminal and run `npm install`. After this has been completed, you can run `npm start` to view the code via the React server, typically at http://localhost:3000. 

## Prototype 
I used the below prototype created using Figma as a basis for my application.
