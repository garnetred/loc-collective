# Abstract

This is a website that uses the Yelp API in order to create a directory of locticians for black people with locs in the United States.

## Tools
This application was bootstrapped with Create React App and uses ReactJS. I used the Jest testing library along with React Testing Library to test each component. I created a low fidelity wireframe, mockup, and prototype using Figma. This site uses Netlify for deployment. 

## Setup/Installation

In order to use this application, you can first clone down this repo using `git clone` followed by the SSH url.

Navigate to the repository's location on your computer. Run the `cd` command to enter the repository, then run `npm install`. After this has been completed, you can run `npm start` to view the code locally at http://localhost:3000 by default.

## Prototype
I used the below prototype created using Figma as a basis for my application.

## Future Iterations
In the future, I hope to add functionality to sort by distance, rating, or price. I also plan to add mobile and tablet responsiveness in the future. Another idea I'm considering is expanding the directory to work outside of the US as well - the difficulty here is the different terminology used to refer to locs all over the world. 

## Final Site
Here's a demo of the current iteration of the site:

## Deployed Site
I've deployed the site via Netlify using continuous deployment. You can view the current site [here](https://loccollective.com). The [backend node server](https://github.com/garnetred/loc-collective-backend) is deployed continuously using Render.
